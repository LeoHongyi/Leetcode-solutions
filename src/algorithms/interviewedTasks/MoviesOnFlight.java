/**
 * I had 2 question on my online assesment, however I remeber only the first one.
 * My code passed only 10 test out of 13. I did a sorting and then found the best pair with 2 for loops
 *
 * Question:
 * You are on a flight and wanna watch two movies during this flight.
 * You are given List<Integer> movieDurations which includes all the movie durations.
 * You are also given the duration of the flight which is d in minutes.
 * Now, you need to pick two movies and the total duration of the two movies is less than or equal to (d - 30min).
 *
 * Find the pair of movies with the longest total duration and return they indexes. If multiple found,
 * return the pair with the longest movie.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: movieDurations = [90, 85, 75, 60, 120, 150, 125], d = 250
 * Output: [0, 6]
 * Explanation: movieDurations[0] + movieDurations[6] = 90 + 125 = 215 is the maximum number within 220 (250min - 30min)
