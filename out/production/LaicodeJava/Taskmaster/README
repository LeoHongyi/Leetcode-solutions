Dependant list elements should be excecuted after the principle list element.
Input 2 lists of dependant and principle lists.
Output the number of tasks that can be excecuted at maximum.
Dependant list: [1,2,3,4,6,5]
principle list: [7,6,4,1,2,1]
For these input lists, the output should be "6" for the tasks that can be accomplished.

Algorithms:
1. Array dependent elements project to each other.
